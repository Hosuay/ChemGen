## 📈 Before/After Comparison

### Before (v1.0):
```python
# Synthetic training data
df_features['Solubility'] = random_formula + noise
# No validation, no filtering, arbitrary predictions
```

### After (v2.0):
```python
# Real ESOL dataset  
df_esol = pd.read_csv('ESOL.csv')
model.train_on_esol(df_esol)
# R² = 0.78, cross-validated, scientifically valid
```
